# ImgTransformer

- Based on ImageSharp

### Feature  

- Use GlobalValue to set some global value
- Use IGenerator to generate an image
- Implement IGenerator to extend new generator

## TODO

- [ ] Use ITransformer to apply some transforms over an image
  - Though ImageSharp already provides some interfaces, they are a little bit complex in my condition

- [ ] Provide a Tasks.tsk file, which describe the task sequence to do on some images file. Then run the program, it will run all the tasks AUTOMATICALLY. Not sure to use some popular language or my own language based on antlr.

## Q & A

- Why English?
  - just for fun, I think anyone who see my repo can understand English. And maybe, I mean, maybe some English speakers can find this repo? In that case, I don't need to prepare an English doc.
